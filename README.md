# Origin-Cap
# 1.19
Addon to Origins mod for server to add a max to origins - only for servers **BUT STILL REQUIRES BOTH CLIENT AND SERVER TO HAVE MODS**

made mainly for my server, but it should work fine for any server

/origincap
  -> reload - reloads files in config
  -> cap
    -> set - sets the global cap for origins (i.e. only 3 merlins)
    -> get - gets current cap
  -> blacklist - set of blacklist commands to make cap ignore particular player, origins, and layers (layers i.e. origins classes)
    -> TO ADD (commands r pretty self explanatory tho, but missing commands and dont have client up rn)
# 1.18
this mod was made in 1.18 originally then I did not end up using it until 1.19 so current version is 1.19, if someone wants me to port it to 1.19 just ask in issues and Ill do it, I just wont go out of my way rn cause idk if anyone even wants it. There is a 1.18 branch, but there were still bugs in it that went unnoticed until 1.19. A port would be easy tho so I could make it if anyone actually requests it.
