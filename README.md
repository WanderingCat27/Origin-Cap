# Origin-Cap
# 1.19
Addon to Origins mod for server to add a max to origins - only for servers **BUT STILL REQUIRES BOTH CLIENT AND SERVER TO HAVE MODS**

made mainly for my server, but it should work fine for any server

#Commands

/origincap
|       -> reload - reloads files in config, so if u edit the cap files manually (only do if u understand what ur doing) u can do /reload
|	
|       -> cap
|  
|               -> set - sets the global cap for origins (i.e. only 3 merlins)
|  
|       	-> get - gets current cap
|  
|       -> blacklist - set of blacklist commands to make cap ignore particular player, origins, and layers (layers i.e. origins classes)
|  
|	        -> origin - makes a specfic origin class etc ignored by the cap

|	        -> player - makes a player get ignored by the cap
| 
|               -> layer - makes a layer i.e origins-classes get ignored by the cap (I use this to make origins have a cap but originsn-classes have no cap)
